Don is a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. He started out like a lot of
other software engineers with the desire to make video games. While making video games with his friends
in high school, he accidentally crashed their game on his friends computer while working on implementing
multiplayer. This diverted his path from video games to cyber security.
